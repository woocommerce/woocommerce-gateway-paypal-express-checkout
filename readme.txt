Accept PayPal, Credit Cards and Debit Cards on your WooCommerce store.

== Description ==

This is a PayPal Express Payment Gateway for WooCommerce.

PayPal Express allows you to securely sell your products and subscriptions online using In-Context Checkout to help you meet security requirements without causing your theme to suffer.  In-Context Checkout uses a modal iFrame, hosted on PayPal's servers, that overlays the checkout form and provides a secure means for your customers to enter their account information.

Also, with Integrated PayPal Setup (Easy Setup), connecting to PayPal is as simple as clicking a button - no complicated API keys to cut and paste.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 4.4 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "WooCommerce PayPal Express Checkout" and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The
WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.
