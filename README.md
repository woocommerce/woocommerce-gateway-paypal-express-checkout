## Repository

* The `/woocommerce/woocommerce-gateway-paypal-express-checkout/` repository is treated as a _development_ repository: this includes development assets, like unit tests and configuration files. Commit history for this repository includes all commits for all changes to the code base, not just for new versions.

## Deployment

A "_deployment_" in our sense means:
 * validating the version in the header and `WC_GATEWAY_PPEC_VERSION` constant match
 * generating a `.pot` file for all translatable strings in the development repository
 * running a custom deploy script
 * the changes will be pushed to a branch with the name `release/{version}` so that a PR can be issued on `/woocommerce/woocommerce-gateway-paypal-express-checkout/`
 * tagging a new version

## Branches

* [`woocommerce/woocommerce-gateway-paypal-express-checkout/trunk`](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gateway-paypal-express-checkout/tree/trunk) includes all code for the current version and any new pull requests merged that will be released with the next version. It can be considered stable for staging and development sites but not for production.
